# Ignoring secrets safely, allowing .enc. secrets
#
# *secret* ignores all files and directories containing "secret" in their name.
# !*.enc.* re-includes any file that contains ".enc." in its name.
# !*secrets*/ re-includes any directory that ends with "secrets".
# With this setup:
# Folders like "secrets" or "my-secrets" will be tracked.
# Files with "secret" in their name will be ignored unless they contain ".enc.".
# Files inside "secrets" folders will be tracked unless they contain "secret" without ".enc.".
