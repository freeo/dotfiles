# Implementation Summary: Microphone Border Sync & Client-Only Management

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Fixed Microphone Border Color Sync Issue

**Problem**: Window border colors didn't stay green when microphone was active during dictation after window focus changes.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added global microphone state tracking in `/widgets/microphone.lua`
- Modified focus/unfocus handlers in `/rc.lua` to respect microphone state
- Border now correctly persists green when microphone is active, regardless of focus changes

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/widgets/microphone.lua` - Added state tracking
- `/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/rc.lua` - Fixed focus handlers (lines 1781-1803)

### 2. Implemented Client-Only Connection Management

**Problem**: No way to connect/disconnect client to running server without full dictation toggle.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added container state detection function
- Implemented client-only start/stop functions
- Added auto-connect/disconnect based on microphone state
- Exposed new public APIs for client management

**New Features**:
- `dictation.StartClientOnly()` - Start client without managing container
- `dictation.StopClientOnly()` - Stop client, leave container running
- `dictation.IsClientRunning()` - Check if client is running
- `dictation.GetContainerState(callback)` - Get container state
- `dictation.ToggleClientOnly()` - Toggle client-only mode

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/widgets/dictation.lua` - Added all client management features

### 3. Auto-Client Connection

**Feature**: Automatically connect/disconnect dictation client based on microphone state when container is running.

**Configuration Options Added**:
```lua
config.auto_client_on_mic = true        -- Auto-start client when mic activates
config.client_only_mode_enabled = true  -- Enable client-only features
config.debug_client_mgmt = false        -- Debug client management
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Client Management
```lua
-- Check container state
dictation.GetContainerState(function(state)
    print("Container state: " .. state)
end)

-- Start client if container is running
dictation.StartClientOnly()

-- Stop client (leaves container running)
dictation.StopClientOnly()
```

### Automatic Client Management
When `auto_client_on_mic` is enabled:
1. Turn on microphone → Client auto-connects if container is running
2. Turn off microphone → Client disconnects to reduce server load
3. Full dictation mode is unaffected

### Testing Border Fix
1. Start dictation or turn on microphone
2. Observe green border
3. Change window focus
4. Border should remain green while microphone is active

## Testing

A test script is provided at:
`/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/test_dictation_enhancements.lua`

Run tests with:
```bash
awesome-client < test_dictation_enhancements.lua
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Decoupled Systems**: Microphone works independently of dictation
2. **State Persistence**: Border colors persist correctly across focus changes
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Client can disconnect when not needed
4. **Flexible Management**: Both manual and automatic client control
5. **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved

## Implementation Status

✅ Phase 1: Border Color Sync - COMPLETE
✅ Phase 2: Client-Only Management - COMPLETE
✅ Phase 3: Integration & Configuration - COMPLETE

All planned features have been successfully implemented and tested.
