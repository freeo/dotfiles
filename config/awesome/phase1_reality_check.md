# Phase 1 Reality Check: What You Can ACTUALLY Do

## The Truth About Phase 1

**Phase 1 does NOT let you switch implementations yet!**

Think of it like this:
- Phase 1 = Building a new engine in the garage
- Phase 2 = Installing the engine in your car
- Right now = You have two engines (old in car, new in garage)

## What Phase 1 ACTUALLY Does

### ✅ What Works Now:
1. **New files exist** with engine definitions
2. **Engine manager can generate commands** (but doesn't use them yet)
3. **Tests verify compatibility** (but don't switch anything)
4. **Your dictation works exactly as before** (using old hardcoded values)

### ❌ What DOESN'T Work Yet:
1. **Cannot switch** between old and new implementation
2. **Cannot use engine manager** for actual dictation
3. **dictation.lua is unchanged** - still uses hardcoded "moshi-stt"
4. **No actual integration** - just preparation

## Commands That Actually Work

### 1. Test the Engine Manager (Standalone)
```bash
# This creates an engine manager and shows what it WOULD do
lua5.4 -e '
  package.path = package.path .. ";/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/?.lua"
  local EngineManager = require("widgets.dictation_engine_manager")
  local em = EngineManager.new()
  em:set_engine("moshi")

  print("Engine Name: " .. em:get_current_engine_name())
  print("Container: " .. em:get_container_name())
  print("Check Cmd: " .. em:get_container_check_cmd())
  print("")
  print("This is what the engine manager WOULD use,")
  print("but dictation.lua is NOT using it yet!")
'
```

### 2. Verify Files Exist
```bash
# These files are created but NOT integrated
ls -la widgets/dictation_engine*.lua
```

### 3. Run Compatibility Test
```bash
# This verifies the engine manager COULD work
lua5.4 test_phase1.lua

# Shows that engine manager produces same commands
# But doesn't actually USE them
```

### 4. Your Current Dictation (Unchanged)
```bash
# This still works exactly as before
# Using hardcoded values in dictation.lua
awesome-client 'require("widgets.dictation").Toggle()'
```

## What You CANNOT Do Yet

```bash
# ❌ This does NOT exist yet:
awesome-client 'require("widgets.dictation").SetEngine("whisper")'

# ❌ This does NOT work:
awesome-client 'require("widgets.dictation").UseEngineManager()'

# ❌ You CANNOT switch implementations
# There is no switch - just two separate systems
```

## The Real Situation

```
Current System (Active):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    dictation.lua        │ ← Using hardcoded "moshi-stt"
│   (UNCHANGED)           │ ← Your actual dictation
└─────────────────────────┘

New System (Ready but NOT Connected):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  dictation_engines.lua  │ ← Defines engines
│         +                │
│ dictation_engine_manager│ ← Can generate commands
└─────────────────────────┘
         ↑
         │
    NOT CONNECTED!
```

## Why Phase 1 Exists

Phase 1 is about:
1. **Creating the infrastructure** without breaking anything
2. **Testing compatibility** before integration
3. **Ensuring safety** before modifying dictation.lua

## What Happens in Phase 2

Phase 2 will:
1. **Modify dictation.lua** to use engine manager
2. **Add actual switching** capability
3. **Connect the two systems** together

## Summary

**Right now you CANNOT switch between implementations because they're not connected!**

- Your dictation uses: **hardcoded values**
- Engine manager exists but: **is not used**
- Phase 1 is: **preparation only**
- To actually switch: **need Phase 2**

## Test What Phase 1 Built

```bash
# See what engine manager produces (not used yet)
lua5.4 -e '
  package.path = package.path .. ";/home/freeo/dotfiles/config/awesome/?.lua"
  local EM = require("widgets.dictation_engine_manager")
  local em = EM.new()
  em:set_engine("moshi")
  print("Engine manager is ready but NOT connected to dictation.lua")
  print("Container it WOULD use: " .. em:get_container_name())
'

# Your actual dictation (unchanged)
awesome-client 'require("widgets.dictation").Toggle()'
```

**Bottom Line**: Phase 1 built the new engine but didn't install it. You can look at the engine, test it, verify it matches, but you can't drive with it yet!
